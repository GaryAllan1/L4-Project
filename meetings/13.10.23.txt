Issues discussed in meeting:
To make the system more scalable and extendable, develop the system as though there will be the option to make multiple quizzes. This can be in the could haves section of the moscow requirements.
For discussion in the dissertation, the purpose of the system is to obtain information on students uses of AI but also for students to learn about the hard topic/quiz area.
Change wording of requirements doc to include teachers/researchers - the system must allow them to retrieve data somehow.

Objectives for coming week:
Modify ER diagram to include the possibility of many quizzes.
Make a sequence diagram
Make the activity diagram on non-paper
Modify System Architecture diagram to mention exact database I'm going to use.
